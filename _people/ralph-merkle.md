Ralph Merkle solved the puzzle of public key cryptography during his undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie invention of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol was directly inspired by Merkle's research. After the public release of public key cryptography in the paper "New Directions in Cryptography" (1976), Merkle studied as a doctural student under Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. During the 80s, Ralph Merkle would go on to invent cryptographic hashing and the concept of Merkle trees.

From wikipedia:

> Adam Back (born July 1970) is a British cryptographer and crypto-hacker.

> He is the inventor of hashcash, the proof-of-work system used by several anti-spam systems. A similar system is used in bitcoin. Hashcash has also been used in a number of other protocols such as combating blog spam, and defending against user namespace pollution.

> He is also known for pioneering the use of ultra-compact code with his 3-line RSA in Perl signature file and non-exportable T-shirts to protest the (now relaxed) United States cryptography export regulations.

> Today he is CEO of Blockstream, a company that seeks to further the development of bitcoin and blockchain technology.
