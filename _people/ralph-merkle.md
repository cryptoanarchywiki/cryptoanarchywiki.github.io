Ralph Merkle solved the puzzle of public key cryptography during his undergraduate studies at UC Berkeley. Martin Hellman and Whitfield Diffie invention of the Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Protocol was directly inspired by Merkle's research. After the public release of public key cryptography in the paper "New Directions in Cryptography" (1976), Merkle studied as a doctural student under Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman. During the 80s, Ralph Merkle would go on to invent cryptographic hashing and the concept of Merkle trees.
